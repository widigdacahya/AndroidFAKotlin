I am very happy for it, I learn a lot and add other material from youtube for exploring this Android world and seeking answer of my curiosity. Here some things :

ðŸ“± The Left one is about Dicoding Class Study case, it is about **GithubUser** application. Using API provided by Github to show a user and its detail. There is Room database for storing data of favorite user. It need to be implemented with MVVM. There is theme preference(Light/Night).
ðŸ“± The right is an app about **Note** that built by following [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YPXv7xKh2w). This is new things for me, the layout built by composable and it is Clean Architecture. When tested on [MAD Board](https://developer.android.com/modern-android-development/scorecard#create-your-scorecard), It gets an awesome resultðŸ‘‡.
